,,mean_scar_area_cm2,"Estimated mean surface area of recent parrotfish predation scars per colony based on the number of recent scars per colony and recoreded min, median, and maximum scar area. We used these estimates to interpolate the distribution of scars on colonies based on a normal distribution of scar sizes bounded by the minimum and maximum scar size and centered on the median scar size with 10000 boostrapped iterations.
