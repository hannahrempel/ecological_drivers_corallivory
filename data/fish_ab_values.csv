Scarus,Scarus taeniopterus,Princess parrotfish,4,0.033497,2.7086,0.85,Southern Florida,Weight (grams) = a x Length (cm) ^b,"As S. taeniopterus have a flat/truncate tail FL and TL values should be interchangeable. Original values are reported for fish lengths in mm and 'a' values were reported as log10(a) for mm. To convert to a standarized 'a' value for fish length in cm we first took the antilog of the log10(a)할.e., 10^a. Then we converted a from mm to cm by multiplying a * 10^b according to fish base conversion instructions (https://fishbase.mnhn.fr/manual/fishbasethe_length_weight_table.htm) ",Bohnsack,Bohnsack J.A. and D.E.
