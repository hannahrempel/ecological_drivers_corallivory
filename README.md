# Ecological Drivers of Parrotfish Corallivory
This repository contains all data analyses and visualization associated with the 2024 publication on 'Ecological drivers of parrotfish coral predation vary across spatial scales' by Rempel and colleagues, published in Marine Ecology Progress Series in 2024 (published Open Access at https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14633). 

Overview:

-The 'code' folder contains R markdown files numbered in sequential order from EDC_1 ... EDC_5. EDC_1 produces a study site map, EDC_2 - EDC_4 are used for data cleaning, integration, and summary for analysis, and EDC 5 contains all data analysis and visualization except for the map (note that you can run this script without running EDC_1 to EDC_4 as cleaned data used for analysis are included in the data folder). EDC_Supplement contains a script used to summarize parrotfish corallivory data from previously published datasets. We conducted all analyses using R v4.3.0.

-The 'data' folder includes the orginal data used in analysis, as well as data files produced in data tidying and preparation for analysis (e.g., bootstrapped_new_scar_data.csv is produced in EDC_2, regional_fish_data.csv in EDC_4).

-The 'figures_tables' folder includes figures and tables produced in scripts. Additionally, it contains fish and coral icons used in the figures.
