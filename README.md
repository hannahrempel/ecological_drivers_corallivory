# ecological_drivers_corallivory
Code associated with paper on 'Ecological drivers of parrotfish coral predation vary across spatial scales' by Rempel and colleagues. We conducted all analyses using R v4.3.0.

We are archiving all raw data through the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information and these raw data are also available in this repository. This repository also contains R markdown scripts used in the analyses associated with this publication. 

R markdown files are meant to be run a sequential order and are numberd EDC_1 ... EDC_5. Some of these markdown files produce datasets used in downstream analysis, such as 'EDC_2_Interpolating_scar_size.Rmd' producing an interpolated scar size distribution. While many of these "downstream"/non-raw datasets are included in this repository, the interpolated scar size distribution must be produced by running that script as the exceedingly large file it produces exceeds Githubs size limits.
